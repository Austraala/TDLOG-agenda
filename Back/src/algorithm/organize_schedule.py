#    PART A - NAIVE OPTIMIZATION
#    How it works :
#    I.
#    - Get today's date : the algorithm will only put tasks for the next day,
#     or the day after that. It won't change anything today.
#    II.
#    - Get the constraints from a list of Fixed_Task, as a list of :
#        Week, Day, Starting Time, Ending Time, Difficulty
#    III.
#    - Merge the constraints if they are the same day and
#     week and there's an overlap in their times.
#    - Order them : week, day, starting times, difficulty (they are already merge if need be)
#    IV.
#    - Order the Mobile_Tasks in the right way
#    V.
#    - Take the first one :
#        - Get to the next day and check if there's time.
#        - If there is, put the Mobile_Task there :
#            - Add a new constraint.
#            - Add a starting time and ending time to the Mobile_Task.
#            - Pop it out.
#        - Get to the next one.
#    VII. SET-UP THE BIG FUNCTION THAT DOES IT

#   UPDATE :
#
#   What I'm modifying :
#       Because Mobile Tasks have no date, they'll be considered to be a list object : [week, day, starting_time,
#           ending_time, name, task].
#       How I handle time, it's now a minute thing (1440 in a day).
#

#   0.  Must create a Constraint Class (it's goint to be easier this way).
